Modelling Technique for GDPR-compliance: Toward a Comprehensive Solution

Data-driven applications and services have been
increasingly deployed in all aspects of life including healthcare
and medical services in which a huge amount of personal data
is collected, aggregated, and processed in a centralised server
from various sources. As a consequence, preserving the data
privacy and security of these applications is of paramount
importance. Since May 2018, the new data protection legislation
in the EU/UK, namely the General Data Protection Regulations
(GDPR), has come into force and this has called for a critical
need for modelling compliance with the GDPRâ€™s sophisticated
requirements. Existing threat modelling techniques are not de-
signed to model GDPR compliance, particularly in a complex
system where personal data is collected, processed, manipulated,
and shared with third parties. In this paper, we present a
novel comprehensive solution for developing a threat modelling
technique to address threats of non-compliance and mitigate them
by taking GDPR requirements as the baseline and combining
them with the existing security and privacy modelling techniques
(i.e., STRIDE and LINDDUN, respectively). For this purpose, we
propose a new data flow diagram integrated with the GDPR
principles, develop a knowledge base for the non-compliance
threats, and leverage an inference engine for reasoning the GDPR
non-compliance threats over the knowledge base. Finally, we
demonstrate our solution for threats of non-compliance with
legal basis and accountability in a telehealth system to show
the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution.
